Ever wondered why, when a chest is open, items don't fall in?<br>
... Okay, I'll admit, me neither, not until I had this idea. But when you think of it...
It just makes sense, right?

So now, you can proudly say that **Chests are chests**! And enjoy making items fall into your storage
instead of lamely putting them in by hand!

But as items can fall *into* an open box... Shouldn't they be able to fall *down* from one as well,
provided it was open on the right side?
Thus, you can make it so barrels, when open and facing down, drop *all* of their content to the ground!

Going back to the chest, if you can open the lid to make items fall in, shouldn't the lid throw items away
upon being opened?
That's right! With this mod, you can make it so opening a chest throws all the items standing on it upon opening!
(Limited to items only for the sake of one's life preservation)

Last but not least, since opening a container has always only been a manual task so far,
in order to allow you to automate these new options, opening a container can now be done
by activating an *empty* dispenser pointing at said container!

Now the game will feel more natural, even just a little bit, won't you agree?
